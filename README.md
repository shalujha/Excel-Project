# What is this project all about?
This is basically an Excel clone that have almost all features of Excel.The features are :<br/>
1)Cell properties : We can click on a particular cell having text and modifiy its properties like make it bold,italic,underlined,font family,font size,font color,background color.<br/>
2)Formulas:In the formula bar,we can write a formula and it will be evaluated and the ans will be placed in active cell (the cell on which we are currently on). A note that we have to keep in mind is we have to write space seperated formula like i have shown in this example : ( A1 + 2 * B1 ), In this way it will get calculated .<br/>
3) In case we have entered some cyclic formula( like if one formula is dependent on another and other formula is dependent on this formula) user will get a prompt that he/she has entered a cyclic formula and will ask if he/she wants to trace it. if she/he wants , then he can color trace it.<br/>
4) user can copy/cut/paste too, he/she will have to copy two cells(source and destination) and cut/copy and further he will click on a cell,on clicking paste, all values will be overwriten.<br/>
5) there is a functionality of mutiple sheet management too, he/she can further add multiple sheets on clicking on addsheet icon at bottom.<br/>
6) The last functionality is user can download current sheet and upload a new excel sheet.<br/>
